<p>Analysis of Natural Gas Stock Closing price with storage, consumption and temeprature.</p>
<p>
The purpose of this project was to determine if there's a relationship between temperature and the price of natural gas. We initially started with the hope of identifying a strong correlation between temperature and natural gas (NG) price. But the analysis we performed did not show the relationship we expected. We also analyzed NG storage and consumption to determine if temperature impacted either and if either had an impact on NG prices.  We found a strong relationship between temperature, NG storage, and NG consumption but not with NG price.
