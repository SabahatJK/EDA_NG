<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Analysis of Natural Gas Stock Closing price with storage, consumption and temeprature.</p>

<p>The purpose of this project was to determine if there's a relationship between temperature and the price of natural gas.<p>
<p>We initially started with the hope of identifying a strong correlation between temperature and natural gas (NG) price.<p> 
<p>But the analysis we performed did not show the relationship we expected.<p> 
<p>We also analyzed NG storage and consumption to determine if temperature impacted either and if either had an impact on NG prices.<p>  
<p>We found a strong relationship between temperature, NG storage, and NG consumption but not with NG price.</p>
